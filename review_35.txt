Summary: I'm spicyyyyyyyyyy
Text: That's pretty much what these ramen noodles has, spiciness. I love spicy noodles like the next guy but even after using only half the packet, it still leaves your mouth hot and spicy. And can barely appreciate the quality of taste these noodles are suppose to bring.<br /><br />It's like when you order the most spiciest buffalo wild wings. You cannot taste the meat but just how hot they are. The same can be said about these supposedly top brand ramen noodles.
